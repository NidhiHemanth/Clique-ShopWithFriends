# Clique - Shop with Friends

Clique brings the social aspect of shopping with friends to online shopping. 

On the app, you can create an online space or a room for you and your most trusted
friends. The room is audio - enabled and lets you share your view of the ecommerce or any other
website that you are viewing. Thus allowing you and your friends to discuss and view the same
products in real-time. 

As a bonus, if you see a product that you or your friends want to save for
later, you can easily copy the link from the website and then tap on the icon of the attendee to
add it to a clipboard, which then sends out the various links to each participant separately.
